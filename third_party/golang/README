Description:
The src subdirectory contains a small number of Go source files
downloaded from https://golang.org/src and modified by the Mojo authors as
described below.

Local Changes:
- The fmt package has been modified with regards to how it uses reflection
to deep print Go structures. Firstly instead of only following pointers
for one level we now follow pointers for 50 levels. Secondly instead of
printing the address of a string pointer we print the string.
